Density-Signature
=================

Here you will find the code required to path-reverse a graph to find its density decomposition and density signature. Also you will find the code required to generate random graphs using the density signature.

Information about the algorithms implemented can be found here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1001

The code here is written in Python, using the igraph library.
